# IDPA 

This project is part of the IDPA project developed by my team and me. The main focus is on building a heated standing table. One of the key features of the table is a sensor that measures the fuel level (pellets). The data collected by the sensor will be displayed in a mobile app, which will also send a notification when it's time to refill the fuel.

The purpose of this repository is to host the code required for this functionality.

A non-scaled sketch of the table can be seen below.
